Hi, I’m Shilpi Datta, a passionate T-shirt designer with a deep love for creativity, storytelling, and wearable expression. My journey into T-shirt design started with a simple idea — to turn everyday thoughts, humor, and emotions into something people can wear proudly. Since then, it’s become more than just a passion — it’s my craft, my brand, and my way of connecting with the world.

As a designer, I specialize in typographic, minimal, bold, vintage, and trend-driven T-shirt art. Whether it’s a powerful one-liner, a funny quote, or a visual that captures a feeling — I aim to make every design speak loudly with simplicity. My work often explores themes like motivation, fatherhood/motherhood, cats, nature, hustle culture, mental health awareness, and more. I love creating designs that not only look good but feel personal to the wearer.

What sets me apart is my attention to trends, detail, and market insight. I study what’s selling, what’s resonating, and how designs perform across platforms like Merch by Amazon, Etsy, Redbubble, and beyond. I believe that successful T-shirt design is a balance of art, psychology, and branding — and I strive to bring that mix into every project.
Every project I take on is treated with care — from ideation and sketching to final mockups and print-ready files. I use tools like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and various AI tools to ensure high-quality and scalable results.

If you’re looking for someone who can bring fresh, meaningful, and sellable T-shirt designs to life — I’m here to collaborate!

📍 Based in Bangladesh, working globally
🎨 Open to freelance work, collaborations, and commissions
